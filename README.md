# Technology-Used

- To build this project I followed the MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm along with handlebars to create a dynamic front-end. To build the server/routes and backend I used express, then mysql and sequelize to make models and connect to a database to store all the information. Then I used dotenv to create the collections, and used bcrypt to hash the user password and safely secure it inside the database.
